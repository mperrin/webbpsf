class NIRISS_GR700XD_Grism(poppy.AnalyticOpticalElement):
    """ Custom optic class to model the NIRISS SOSS grim GR700XD

    This includes both the pupil mask file and the cylindrical lens

    Based on inputs from Loic Albert, Anand Sivaramakrishnan, and Andre Martel
    In particular see FGS_TFI_UdM_035_RevD for details of the NIRISS GR700XD
    measurement, and JWST-STScI-003338 for detector orientation and layout.

    GRISM DESIGN:

    The grism (and cylinder) are per design rotated by 2 degrees so as to be able
    to sample an emission line across different pixel position along the spatial
    direction (kind of resampling the line and not be limited by intra pixel
    response).

    From Loic Albert's NIRISS technical report:

        * surface sag for the cylinder: 3.994 micron peak
        * limited to 3.968 microns for the 26 mm FOV mask

    From Loic Albert's email to Marshall 2013-07-18:

            I do have an update concerning the geometry of the GR700XD pupil
            mask. It turns out that they clocked the grism by about 2.25 degrees wrt the
            OTE system of coordinates. However, the field mask did not follow and is still
            aligned along the OTE s.o.c. That was a mistake that fortunately does have much
            impact.

            Comdev is in the process of modelling a new mask for the
            Spare grism. Remember that we will swap the current FLight GR700XD for
            its Spare which offers much improved performances. The mask size will
            be a little different (rectangular) and this time will be clocked 2.25
            degrees along with the grism.

            The sign of the rotation of the grism will have to be
            devised by trying the 2 possibilities an looking at the resulting tilt
            of the monochromatic PSF and the position of that PSF on the detector.
            Attached is a simulation of what we expect based on my own PSF
            generator.

            The cylinder lens has a well characterized power (actually radius of curvature). The values are:
                current Flight: 22.85 meters
                Spare: 22.39 meters

            Prism physical size: pupil is 26 mm on a side for the current prism, will be 28 mm for the spare

    From Loic Albert's email to Marshall 2013-09-19:

        The latest news on this front are:

        1 - The current Flight mask is attached. It is 26x26 mm. The mask and grism are
            *not* aligned along the same coordinates. That was a mistake. I'll forward you
            a message from Michael M., our optics expert at CSA.

        2 - The Spare mask (likely the one which will fly) is not built yet. The mask
            will be aligned along the grism coordinate and both will be clocked 2.2 deg wrt
            the OTE.

        3 - A ghost analysis showed that the current grism clocking will suffer from
            large ghosts. So we are studying how to clock the Spare grism in its cell to
            minimize ghosts. Likely a 90 degrees rotation will be applied to baseline of
            point 2.

        From Michael.Maszkiewicz@asc-csa.gc.ca:

            As far as I understand now, we have two rotations in the as-built
            GR700. One rotation is for the prism-grism combo by 2 deg CCW, looking along
            the local +z axis, and the second rotation is for  the mask by 3.05 deg  but
            CW. As a result there is total 5.05 deg rotation between grism and its mask.
            See my annotations to your drawing attached.

    From Loic Albert's email to Marshall 2014-05-20:

        I should have pointed that the power assumed in my simulations for the cylindrical lens
        was off. It was one of the conclusions of CV1RR. The actual radius of curvature of the
        cylinder is 25.3 meters (rather than the smaller figure I used before).

     ORIENTATION:

        See Figure 2 of JWST-STScI-003338
        In "DMS" coordinates, as projected looking outwards onto the sky,
        The GR700XD grating trace is near the extreme right edge of the detector
        with long wavelengths closest to (2048,2048) and short wavelengths nearest (2048,0)
        (The raw detector coordinates are very different from this due to a 180 degree rotation)

        **PLEASE NOTE** that the DMS when processing spectral data performs an additional transformation:
            For spectral data, the science X-axis is aligned with the detector
            dispersion direction and the science frame Y-axis is at a right angle
            to the X-axis in a right-handed coordinate system (Swade 2003)

        We choose here to ignore that complication; WebbPSF simulates the 2D sky projected
        image in "Sci" coordinates in the terminology for SIAF from Lallo et al.
        In this coordinate system, the dispersion from the cylinder lens is aligned
        almost along V2 and the longer wavelengths are oriented toward +V3.
